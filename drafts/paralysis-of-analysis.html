      <p>Since being involved in the creation of much larger and complex systems, I have
taken a much slower and careful approach to the phases involved before
development begins. I now view the planning, design, modeling and architecture
of a system playing an equal or even greater part than the coding of the system
itself.</p>
<p>However, I have noticed a recurring pattern emerging, especially as these
systems become larger. One of my coworkers has alerted me that I have been
entering a state known as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis">analysis paralysis</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Analysis paralysis or paralysis of analysis is the state of over-analyzing (or
over-thinking) a situation so that a decision or action is never taken, in
effect paralyzing the outcome.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a very common situation especially for developers, but it occurs in all
aspects of life. As I've been catching myself falling into this situation much
more often, I knew I had to become better at two things:
developing an awareness for when I have been paralyzed with choices for too
long, and figuring out a way to get out of it.</p>
<p>So, what do you do when you have too many options?</p>
<h1>Awareness</h1>
<p>Like any other problem, becoming aware of its existence is always the first
step.</p>
<p>When developing software, there are a few techniques and questions that I ask
to help me identify when I have been in paralysis for too long:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>When was the last time I was at a keyboard?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Have I been thinking about an implementation longer than it would have taken
  to just make it?</strong></li>
<li>blah blah</li>
</ul>
<h1>Eliminate choice</h1>
<p>Narrow it down to 2</p>
<h1>Letting go of perfect</h1>
<p>Part of being an engineer is recognizing the trade offs and when they make sense</p>
<h1>Prototype</h1>
<ul>
<li>Talk about the trade off,</li>
<li>Talk about Apple</li>
<li>Talk about software</li>
</ul>
